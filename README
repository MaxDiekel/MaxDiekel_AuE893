Primary README

This repository is for the use in AuE893. The repository contains a source folder with assignment repositories for each assignment. When this source folder is built with catkin_make, each of these assignment folders correspond to different assignments (for example, the first package is called assignment_1 and it has a couple nodes such as robot_cleaner_node). To use this repository, first clone the repository. Then, catkin_make the repository from the primary folder. Finally, source the setup.bash file in the devel folder. For more information about a specific assignment, view the readme in the src/assignment_x/ folder.
